classic minesweeper implementation


WebSweeper - an Ode to classic 'Minesweeper'
 
 
Author:  Greg Hammond  
 Original development ~2015
 
 Revision History: 
  - 10/11/2019 rewrote / re-implemented.  Created git repo.
  - 2/4/23 no changes, just noting how primitive and simple this is... and that "just works", still, because there are no packages, no dependencies!  resisting the urge to "modernize" this.  leave it as a time capsule!
   

 future work:
  - have smily face if win
  - need to get icons for 6/7/8

  - RWD.  @media handling.
  - Move to Angular/TS
  - reimplement with canvas?
  - user select levels / mines / size
  - 'high scores'
